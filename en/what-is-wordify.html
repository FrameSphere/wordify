            <p class="article-intro">Wordify is a free online word game where every day you must guess a new 5-letter word in at most 6 attempts. Find out everything you need to know about Wordify – from its origins to the rules of the game.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-body">

            <h2>What exactly is Wordify?</h2>
            <p>Wordify is a daily word-guessing game you can play directly in your browser – no app download, no account, and completely free. The concept is simple: every day a secret <strong>5-letter word</strong> is chosen, and your task is to discover it through targeted guesses. You have exactly <strong>six attempts</strong> before the game ends.</p>
            <p>After each word you enter, you receive immediate color-coded feedback that tells you which letters are correct and which are in the wrong position. This system of attempt and feedback makes Wordify a logical thinking game that is easy to learn but remains challenging every day.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The key facts at a glance:</strong> A new 5-letter word every day, 6 attempts, color feedback after each guess – free and playable in your browser without signing up.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The history and idea behind Wordify</h2>
            <p>The concept of a word-guessing game with color feedback became famous in 2021 through Wordle, which spread rapidly across the internet. Wordify takes this proven gameplay and expands it with multilingual support, a modern design, and daily new words in <strong>five different languages</strong>.</p>
            <p>The idea behind Wordify is to offer everyone – regardless of language level – an entertaining and educational word game. While many similar games are only available in one language, Wordify lets you choose between English, German, Spanish, French, and Italian.</p>
            <p>Wordify was developed with the idea of providing a small daily mental workout. The game rarely takes more than five minutes, but offers enough depth to bring regular players joy every single day.</p>

            <h2>How does the color system work?</h2>
            <p>The heart of Wordify is its color feedback system. After each valid word you submit, the letters are shown in one of three colors:</p>

            <div class="color-demo">
                <div class="color-row">
                    <div class="color-tile tile-green">W</div>
                    <div class="color-text"><strong style="color: var(--correct)">Green:</strong> The letter is correct and in the right position in the target word. Keep it there!</div>
                </div>
                <div class="color-row">
                    <div class="color-tile tile-yellow">O</div>
                    <div class="color-text"><strong style="color: var(--present)">Yellow:</strong> The letter is in the word but in the wrong position. Try it somewhere else.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="color-row">
                    <div class="color-tile tile-gray">X</div>
                    <div class="color-text"><strong style="color: var(--text-secondary)">Gray:</strong> The letter is not in the target word at all. You can eliminate it from future guesses.</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This system lets you gradually close in on the target word. With each attempt you learn more about the word's composition and can make your next guess more precisely. That's what makes Wordify a true thinking game that rewards logical deduction.</p>

            <h2>What makes Wordify special?</h2>
            <p>Compared to other word-guessing games, Wordify has several features that make it stand out:</p>

            <h3>Multilingual</h3>
            <p>While most similar games are available in only one language, Wordify currently supports five: English, German, Spanish, French, and Italian. You can switch languages at any time and practice your vocabulary in each one.</p>

            <h3>Daily new challenge</h3>
            <p>A new word awaits you every day. The word changes at midnight and is the same for all players worldwide – whether you're in London, New York, or Sydney. This lets you discuss today's puzzle with friends and exchange hints.</p>

            <h3>Statistics and progress</h3>
            <p>Wordify saves your game statistics locally in the browser. You can check your progress at any time: how many games you've played, your win rate, your current winning streak, and your longest streak ever. This keeps you motivated to return daily and improve your stats.</p>

            <h3>Share your result</h3>
            <p>After every completed game – win or lose – you can share your result with one click. The share function creates a spoiler-free representation of your attempts as colored tiles, which you can post on social media or send via message.</p>

            <h3>No download, no account</h3>
            <p>You don't need to install an app or create a user account. Wordify runs entirely in your browser on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Just open the page – and you're ready to play.</p>

            <h2>Who is Wordify for?</h2>
            <p>Wordify is for everyone who enjoys language and brain games. Whether as a quick break at the office, vocabulary training for language learners, or a relaxing evening ritual – Wordify fits into any routine. It's especially suited for:</p>
            <p><strong>Language enthusiasts:</strong> Those who love playing with words and want to expand their vocabulary will find a daily challenge in Wordify. The game implicitly teaches new words and spellings without feeling like studying.</p>
            <p><strong>Puzzle fans:</strong> The logical deduction Wordify requires is similar to other popular brain games. If you enjoy Sudoku, crosswords, or similar puzzles, you'll love Wordify too.</p>
            <p><strong>Language learners:</strong> Wordify is ideal for people learning a foreign language. By playing in another language, you actively train your vocabulary in a realistic context.</p>
            <p><strong>All ages:</strong> The gameplay is so intuitive that it can be enjoyed by children from about age 10 up to seniors. Wordify also works great as a shared family activity.</p>

            <h2>The daily game limit in Wordify</h2>
            <p>To ensure a fair and balanced experience, Wordify has a daily limit of 15 games per 12 hours. This limit applies to new random games. The daily main puzzle – the same for all players – is unaffected and can be played at any time.</p>
            <p>This system is designed to keep Wordify a daily ritual rather than a time-consuming endless game. Short, focused, and daily – that's Wordify's motto.</p>

            <h2>Wordify and learning new words</h2>
            <p>Many Wordify players report that daily play has significantly expanded their vocabulary. When you don't guess a word and the answer is revealed, you automatically learn something new. Over weeks and months, new words accumulate.</p>
            <p>The effect is particularly interesting when playing in a foreign language. The light frustration and satisfaction of the game help new words stick in memory especially well. Language psychologists call this "emotional learning" – content linked to emotions is stored more durably.</p>

            <h2>How often does a new word appear?</h2>
            <p>Every day at midnight (server time), the daily puzzle is updated. There is exactly one official daily puzzle per language. Between two daily puzzles, you can guess additional words in random mode – subject to the daily limit mentioned above.</p>
            <p>The words for the daily puzzle are carefully selected: they should be familiar enough that most players have a fair chance of guessing them, yet challenging enough not to be immediately obvious. Very rare technical terms or heavily archaic words are deliberately avoided.</p>

            <h2>Wordify vs. Wordle: What's the difference?</h2>
            <p>Wordle is the original word-guessing game developed by Josh Wardle in 2021 and later acquired by The New York Times. Wordify is an independent evolution of the concept with some key differences:</p>
            <p>The biggest difference is <strong>multilingual support</strong>: Wordify is playable in five languages, while the original Wordle is only available in English. Wordify also offers a more modern interface, a built-in timer that measures your game time, and a more detailed statistics view.</p>
            <p>Wordify also has a Dark Mode for comfortable evening play, and is fully privacy-compliant – all game progress is stored only locally in the browser, with no data transferred to external servers.</p>

            <h2>Summary: Wordify in brief</h2>
            <p>Wordify is the ideal daily brain game for everyone who loves language and wants to train their mind. It's free, playable instantly without signing up, supports five languages, and delivers a new challenge every day. The smart color feedback system makes Wordify a fair and educational game for all ages.</p>
            <p>Try it today – your daily word is already waiting for you!</p>
